# Startup Nights

> 2 & 3 November 2023 - Eulachhallen Winterthur, Switzerland

## It's more than an startup event

The Startup Nights is comparable to a huge family reunion for the entire startup ecosystem. Where everyone belongs and feels at home.
But as the startup family grows, it needs a bigger home. That is why Startup Nights aim to get bigger and better every year.

## A team on a mission

We are a team of 45 passionate people, many of us are entrepreneurs ourselves, and we organize Startup Nights 2022 in our spare time. Purely out of passion.
We are convinced that startups and innovation must be much more present and valued in Switzerland – because they shape the future.
With Startup Nights, we want the Swiss startup ecosystem to grow. Further, we want to create awareness for startups and their innovations with an impact far beyond the startup scene.
Impressions

The family grew from 1000 to 8000 visitors in 5 years. We helped the community to connect, grow, and get inspired – year after year at the Startup Nights. But see for yourself.
